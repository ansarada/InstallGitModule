# InstallGitModule

This module is a fork of [InstallModuleFromGitHub](https://github.com/dfinke/InstallModuleFromGitHub)

It was forked cause the original didn't seem to be accepting pull requests however was not working as needed and an updated version would need to be submitted to the PowerShell Gallery.

This can handle slightly more complicated github modules and more closely matches PowerShell convention by using -Scope rather than -DestinationPath.

Aside from those it functions largely the same.
